Hello there! Here i will uplod some random tests i made by my own just to practice.

Test 1
I`m going to test https://www.abv.bg/ registration form.
I will try to create a profile without filling any of the mandatory fields. Here is what i found:)

1. Open URL https://www.abv.bg/
2. Click on "Регистрация в АБВ" in the top right corner of the page.
3. User is redirected to registration form.
4. Scroll to the verry end of the page and click on the green button "създай АБВ профил"

Expected result:
An inscription must appear against each mandatory field in red colour.
User is not registered and stay on the same page.

Actual Result:
There is no inscription against "Пол" and "Дата на раждане". They are marcked as mandatory with " * "
