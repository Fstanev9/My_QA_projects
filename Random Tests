3. User is redirected to registration form.
4. Scroll to the verry end of the page and click on the green button "създай АБВ профил"

Expected result:
An inscription must appear against each mandatory field in red colour.

Test 5
Today i found something really interesting. I found a BUG in the website on one of the mobile operators in Bulgaria.I'm speaking about Vivacom.

Here is what we are going to do today. WE are going to go on provider website,we are going to choose one subscription plan he provides
( for example "Unlimited 150" ),than we are going to try to order it.

1. Open URL https://www.vivacom.bg/bg
2. Click on the icon In the middle under which it says "Мобилни услуги"
3. you will be redirected to the next page ith the correct content.
4. We will choose the first plan, so click on the "КУПИ" button on your right side of your screen
5. We have to click on the check box "* Общи условия за мобилни услуги" because we cannot proceed.
6. Next step is to click on the "Продължи като гост" button.
7. User is redirected to page where he has to fill in all mandatory fields which are marcked with "*"
8. On this step we are not going to fill the form with correct information, instead we are going to scroll to the very end of the page
and going to click on "Напред" button.

That`s how we are going to test the validation of all mandatory fields.

Expected result:
Below all mandatory fields where the user has to write something should appear red warning sign.

Actual result:
We have some field marcked as mandatory and there is no red warning sign below

P.S.
I just saw somethin else.
on the very end of the page, there is a check box "Съгласен съм сПолитика за поверителност и защита на личните данни" 
which is not marcked as a mandatory with "*" , but it sill require to be clicked to proceed. Soo this is a bonus today :)

So there it goes, another BUG we found :)
